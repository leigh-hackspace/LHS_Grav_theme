### Leigh Hackspace 3.0
Not long after this bold move everything changed, the global pandemic meant that all work was halted.  The situation was frustrating and all plans had to be put on hold.  During this time a number of other issues arose surrounding the building the new space was part of.  These circumstances unfortunately caused further delays.

As of today the build of Leigh Hackspace V.3.0 is still underway, a dedicated team of volunteers continue to spend their free time working towards a common goal.  If Leigh Hackspace sounds like a place you might be interested in, why not [visit us](/contact) and get involved?
