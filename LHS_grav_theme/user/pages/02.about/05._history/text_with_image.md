### History of Leigh Hackspace
Leigh Hackspace was initially set up as a Facebook group and garnered plenty of interest for local supporters. Before long, everyone involved in this early stage realised that there was a demand for a physical space where people could gather, share their ideas and resources, and work on projects together.

Luckily, Leigh Hackspace was able to obtain space through an empty shop scheme and moved into a disused retail unit in Leigh town centre on Market Street.  Having a shopfront helped spread the word, the space grew quickly and soon Leigh Hackspace was ready to expand into even larger premises. In 2016 Leigh Hackspace moved into larger premises within a former millâ€™s warehouse space.
