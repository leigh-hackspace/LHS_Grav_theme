Leigh Hackspace is situated on the third floor of Leigh Spinners Mill. We are fully **wheelchair accessible** thanks to ramp and lift access, and free on-site parking is available.

Feel free to pop down and say hello, our facilities are available for members, but our doors are open for visitors and curious passersby.
