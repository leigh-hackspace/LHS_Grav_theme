Leigh Hackspace's well-stocked workshop is available for all your woodworking projects. Whether you need access to a specific tool or just the space to work, you can do it here. Our workspace is ideal for larger projects that you may not have the space for at home.

Plenty of scrap wood is available to use as you wish, and our community of members are on hand to offer advice or guidance if you need it.
