Are you looking for somewhere quiet to work from in the North West? Whether you're starting a business, growing one, or just lack the space to work from home Leigh Hackspace offers you co-working space in a creative environment. Just bring your laptop, claim a desk and get to work. 

If you need access to a computer we have a suite of machines running either Windows or Linux that are free for members to use, as are any of our other facilities. Tea and locally-sourced coffee is available in our recreational bar area. Grab a brew and have a chat or learn something new from our broad range of reading materials. 

Since we are located in Leigh Spinners Mill you will also have access to all the other businesses housed here, including a cafe providing great food, a gym, an even an independent cinema. Free on-site parking is also available.
