### Solve problems
Visit Leigh Hackspace and solve all of these problems – we provide workspace, inspiration, equipment, ideas, support, training and even some materials for ‘hacking’. All with a great community spirit and a ‘can-do’ atmosphere. 

‘Hackspaces’ have nothing to do with computer ‘hacking’ (although it’s a great place to come and learn how to program or otherwise master your computer).
