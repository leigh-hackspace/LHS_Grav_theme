Leigh Hackspace is a shared community workspace that offers the facilities you need to make a bunch of stuff you’re not able to make at home. Maybe you don’t have the right tools? Maybe you don’t have enough space? Maybe you’re stuck trying to figure out a problem you’re not able to solve on your own? We’re here to help!
