### Moving to Leigh Spinners Mill
The space continued to grow and evolve and in 2019 the decision was taken to move into Leigh Spinners Mill, to be part of the vibrant community of  local organisations and businesses that had started to flourish.  It was going to be a big job, our volunteers were going to physically build out the space to our communityâ€™s bespoke specifications.  The project was ambitious but the team of volunteers were passionate, determined and excited to have such an amazing opportunity.  The build began in November.
